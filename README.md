# Impact of Social Media on Mental Health – Data Analysis & Visualisation

---

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **social media usage and mental health indicators** using survey-based data. The aim is to understand how usage patterns across different platforms relate to emotional wellbeing, concentration, anxiety, validation-seeking behaviour, and depressive symptoms.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation, the project highlights trends that may help explain how excessive or purposeless social media use correlates with negative mental health outcomes, particularly among young adults.

## Objectives
- Analyse social media usage patterns across demographic groups  
- Examine associations between screen time and mental health indicators  
- Identify behavioural patterns linked to anxiety, distraction, and low mood  
- Communicate findings through clear, interpretable visualisations

## Dataset
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health 
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Key Attributes Include:**  
  - Age, Gender, Relationship Status  
  - Social Media Use (Yes/No)  
  - Platforms Used (e.g. Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook)  
  - Daily Time Spent on Social Media  
  - Mental health indicators such as:
    - Distraction level  
    - Restlessness without social media  
    - Difficulty concentrating  
    - Comparison with others  
    - Validation-seeking behaviour  
    - Frequency of feeling depressed or down  

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and formatted timestamp and categorical variables  
- Standardised survey scale responses for consistency  
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Converted multi-platform responses into analysable formats  
- Grouped time-based usage into interpretable ranges  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualisation
The analysis focused on uncovering patterns through:
- Distribution plots of daily social media usage  
- Bar charts comparing mental health scores across usage levels  
- Platform-wise comparisons of reported anxiety and distraction  
- Gender-based and age-based mental health trends  
- Correlation analysis between usage intensity and wellbeing indicators  

Visualisations were designed to be:
- Intuitive and easy to interpret  
- Suitable for non-technical audiences  
- Useful for academic and policy discussions  

---

## Key Insights
- Higher daily social media usage is associated with increased distraction and restlessness  
- Users who frequently engage without a specific purpose report higher anxiety levels  
- Comparison with others and validation-seeking behaviour show strong links to low mood  
- Platforms with visual-centric content exhibit stronger associations with negative self-perception  
- Moderate usage groups consistently report better concentration and emotional balance  

---

## Practical Implications
- Highlights the importance of **mindful and purposeful social media use**  
- Supports the need for digital wellbeing education among students and young adults  
- Provides evidence to inform discussions on mental health awareness and online behaviour
